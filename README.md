mocketoy
========

Client-Server Toy initially designed for our talk at Europython 2013

- Morpheus is your real server, that's exactly what we want to mock;
- Neo is your client, basically what we want to test.

Mocket shows its power in the tests file, where you can see the first test using the real server, and a couple of tests using *mocketize* decorator.
